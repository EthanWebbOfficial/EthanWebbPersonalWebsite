Due to having family in the vulnerable category, I was unable to join the key workers during the pandemic. As a result, I decided to start a new habit of reading. Since then, I have learnt a huge amound about business, psychology and the world around me. Reading has been a great way to challenge my preconceptions and the mental models my brain has built of the world. It has also been a goos outlet for learning from the mistakes of others. In 2022, my goals is to read <b>52 Books</b> - I have am currently <b>on book number 4</b>.
