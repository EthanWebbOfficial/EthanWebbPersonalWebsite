In 2020, I started to make reading a habit. Due to having family in the vulnerable category, I was unable to join the key workers during the pandemic. As a result, I decided to start a new habit of reading. Since then, I have learnt a huge amount about business, psychology and the world around me. Reading has been a great way to challenge my preconceptions, and challenge the mental models my brain has built of the world. It has also been a good outlet for learning from the mistakes of others. In 2022, my goals is to read 52 Books - I am currently on book number 4. If you want a book recommendation, feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn!
