Hello, I'm Ethan and I am an MSc Statistics student at Lancaster University, United Kingdom. 

I graduated from Lancaster University with a First Class BSc in Mathematics in 2021 and decided to stay at the University to pursue a masters degree. I have a keen interest in <mark>using Statistics and Data Analytics to make a positive change in the world</mark> and I enjoy the challenge of using my statistical analysis skills to tackle real world problems.

I have worked on a number of projects at University, with my most notable work being for the Lancaster University Mock Investment Fund - the 'Ghosal Fund'. In my role as a Quantitative Analyst, my team and I built an Automated Value At Risk system in Python measuring and forecasting portfolio volatility. We used a GARCH time series model to forecast the stock variance.

My hope is that I can use this website to showcase my project work, both within my degree and outside my studies, so that I can continue to learn and apply my skills as I did in this previous project.

Outside of my studies, I am interested in sports and I am a loyal fan to both Birmingham City Football Club, and the Los Angeles Rams. I also enjoy reading about business and psychology.

Due to having family in the vulnerable category, I was unable to join the key workers during the pandemic. As a result, I decided to start a new habit of reading. Since then, I have learnt a huge amound about business, psychology and the world around me. Reading has been a great way to challenge my preconceptions and the mental models my brain has built of the world. It has also been a goos outlet for learning from the mistakes of others. In 2022, my goals is to read <b>52 Books</b> - I have am currently <b>on book number 4</b>.
